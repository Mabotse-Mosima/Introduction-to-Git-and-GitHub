# Introduction-to-Git-and-GitHub

In this module, I was introduced to the concept of version control, which has made managing and rolling back my code so much easier. I learned how to differentiate between files and discovered the tools available to help with that. Then, I got introduced to Git and explored how it can enhance my coding workflow. After understanding what Git is, I installed it and started using it to create and clone repositories.

Next, I dove deeper into Git to get familiar with its various tools and commands. I learned how to skip the staging area for small code changes and understood how Git uses the HEAD alias to represent the currently checked-out snapshot. I also practiced how to move and remove files, and reviewed a handy study guide to reinforce my Git skills.

I then focused on how to undo changes before committing, and how to amend commits after they've been submitted. I even learned how to track down and identify errors in past commits.

In the final part of this section, I explored branching and merging. I learned what branches are, how to create them, and how they help me work more flexibly with my code. Once I was comfortable with branching, I practiced merging and learned how to resolve merge conflicts effectively.

Then I moved on to GitHub, where I learned how it integrates with Git. I created new repositories and cloned them to my local machine. I explored the concept of a remote repository, how to work with them, and how they’re hosted. I got comfortable with commands like modify, stage, and commit for local changes, and used fetch to pull updates from remote repositories. I also learned about SSH and API keys, and when to use each.

I wrapped up this part by learning how to deal with conflicts in pull-merge-push workflows, how to push remote branches, and how to rebase my changes.

Finally, I explored the collaboration tools Git offers. I learned how to improve code quality and track changes more efficiently. I got a clear understanding of pull requests and the typical GitHub workflow for submitting them. I also learned how to squash commits and reviewed a study guide on forks and pull requests.

I then explored code reviews—what they are, how they work, and how to use them effectively on GitHub. To finish the module, I learned how to manage projects, follow best practices for collaboration, track issues, and understood how continuous integration (CI) ties it all together.
